# Missing Components for the Sales Management System

## Overview
This document outlines the missing components necessary for the completion of the Sales Management System developed for the "Programming Concepts" course.

### 1. SalesmanInfoHandler
The `SalesmanInfoHandler` class is responsible for managing and retrieving information about salesmen from a file.

#### Expected Methods:
- **loadSalesmanInfo(String filePath)**: Loads salesman information from a specified file.
- **getSalesmanName(long id)**: Returns the name of the salesman based on their ID.
- **getSalesmanList()**: Provides a list of all salesmen.

### 2. ProductInfoHandler
The `ProductInfoHandler` class manages product information and handles loading product data.

#### Expected Methods:
- **loadProductInfo(String filePath)**: Loads product information from a specified file.
- **getProductName(int id)**: Returns the name of the product based on its ID.
- **getProductPrice(int id)**: Returns the price of the product based on its ID.
- **getProductsInfo()**: Provides a map of product information for validation.

### 3. ErrorHandler
The `ErrorHandler` class is designed for logging errors encountered during data processing.

#### Expected Methods:
- **logError(String message)**: Logs an error message to a log file or console.
- **getErrorLog()**: Returns the current error log for debugging purposes.

## Implementation Status
The implementation of the above classes is still pending and is essential for the functionality of the Sales Management System.

## Next Steps
- Develop the `SalesmanInfoHandler`, `ProductInfoHandler`, and `ErrorHandler` classes.
- Implement the expected methods for each class.
- Integrate these components into the main application.

## Notes
Further enhancements may include unit tests for each of these classes to ensure reliability and accuracy in processing sales data.
